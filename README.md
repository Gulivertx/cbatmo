# CBatmo
*A **Netatmo Weather Station** Web-APP for Raspberry Pi &amp; official Raspberry touchscreen.*

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gulivertx/cbatmo/master/screenshots/screenshot_011.png)

For my Netatmo Weather Station I was looking for a display information to have a quick look 
of the measures done by the station. I looked at the WEB to find something but finally did not 
find what I was really looking for. Then, I decided to use one of my Pi to develop a small touch 
application and finally share a part of my work.

This is a rewrite of a first version of my APP which included **Netatmo API, Google Calendar API, 
Swiss Weather forecast API and WebcamTravel API**. For this public 
release I removed Google Calendar API, WebcamTraval API and change Swiss Weather 
API by Dark Sky API. The first proposal can be found in the [Netatmo forum](https://forum.netatmo.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=14458)

## Development
This project is a Web APP write in Javascript / Typescript with **[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** for the frontend and **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** for the backend.

The main focus of this app is :
* Must works well with a Raspberry Pi 3
* Optimized for a official Raspberry Pi touch monitor 7" (800x480)
* Design to use 5 Netatmo modules (MAIN, OUTDOOR, INDOOR, RAIN and WIND)

## How to try this APP
### Build for development - from a MacOS, Linux(not ARM) or Windows computer
First you will need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed in your main computer and then follow the next steps.

* Clone the repo
* Install yarn dependencies packages (Becareful, if you use a Debian based distributions yarn is usually to old in the official repository, install yarn via npm. `npm install -g yarn` will always the last version and fix the issue)
* Create a new .env file with API keys
* Build and run the DEV server

#### Clone and install yarn dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gulivertx/cbatmo.git
cd cbatmo
yarn
```

#### Create a new .env file
Copy the file `.env.dist` to `.env` in the root project folder. Edit the new file and fill your **Netatmo information** and **OpenWeather information**.
If you do not have these, you have to create new credentials to [Netatmo developer](https://dev.netatmo.com) and
[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). All are free.

#### Run the DEV server
To build the app and start the DEV server just use the command `yarn run watch`.
The DEV server will only start if in the file `.env` the variable **APP_ENV** is set to **dev**.

If everything works fine you should be able to reach the application from your favorite browser http://localhost:3000. 
To have the correct display size you must change your browser to handle a resolution of 800x480.
In Chrome you have to open the chrome-dev-tools, set the display to **responsive** and choose a resolution of **800x480**.

Now your can start to modify any files, webpack will rebuild automatically your changes, just refresh the web-browser to see you changes.
Enjoy !!!

### Build for production - from a MacOS, Linux(not ARM) or Windows computer
If the repo is not already cloned do th same steps as development.

#### Clone and install yarn dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gulivertx/cbatmo.git
cd cbatmo
yarn
```

#### Create or edit the .env file
Copy the file `.env.dist` to `.env` if it is not already created and edit it by filling your **Netatmo information** and **Dark Sky information**.

**Change the first variable `APP_ENV=dev` to `APP_ENV=prod`.**

#### Deploy to the Raspberry Pi - Automatic deployment 
**DEPRECATED, this is still working but do a build that is not necessary anymore when you never build the app yourself**

**If you work from a MacOS or Linux OS** you can use the script `deploy.sh` to auto build, auto deploy CBatmo to your Raspberry. To use this script you
need to configure your Raspberry Pi. Just be sure that the followings things are configured correctly in your Raspberry:

* SSH server running
* sudo configured and allow the user to run commands without any password

Edit the file `rpi/cbatmo.service` and change the **WorkingDirectory** where cbatmo will be installed (should by /user/YOUR_USERNAME/cbatmo).
In a Raspbian it should by **/user/pi/cbatmo**, in an ArchLinux it should be **/user/alarm/cbatmo**. Now modifiy the user and group of your
Raspberry user. For the Raspbian use **pi** as user and group. For Archlinux use **alarm** as user and group.

Now run the script :
````bash
cd rpi
./deploy.sh
````

![deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gulivertx/cbatmo/master/screenshots/cbatmo_deploy.gif)

Follow the steps asked by the script and at the end you should have a working instance of CBatmo deployed to your Raspberry and running.

From your computer web-browser try to reach your Raspberry Pi by filling the ip address with port 3000 of your raspberry ex.: http://10.0.0.10:3000.

#### Deploy to the Raspberry Pi - Manual deployment
For Windows user there is no deploy script, then you have to follow these steps.

##### Build the app in prod mode
Be sure to set the variable **APP_ENV** to **prod** in the `.env` file. Then build the app:
```bash
yarn run build
```
At the end of the build process you will find new files in `public` folder and a new **index.ejs** in the folder `views`.

Edit the file `rpi/cbatmo.service` and change the **WorkingDirectory** where cbatmo will be installed (should by /user/YOUR_USERNAME/cbatmo).
In a Raspbian it should by **/user/pi/cbatmo**, in an ArchLinux it should be **/user/alarm/cbatmo**. Now modifiy the user and group of your
Raspberry user. For the Raspbian use **pi** as user and group. For Archlinux use **alarm** as user and group.

##### Create an archive
The best way to transfer the app to your Raspberry is to create an archive. Create for instance a ZIP file with 7Zip call `cbatmo.zip` and add the following contents inside:

* public
* rpi
* views
* .env
* package.json
* server.js
* yarn.lock

**Do not add the node_modules folder !!**. Clients, logs, and screenshots is not necessary to run the app on your Pi.

##### Transfer the archive cbatmo.zip to the Pi
To transfer the archive, you can just copy and paste it with an USB key, or if your are comfortable with ssh/sftp just use it.
Uncompress the archive in the Pi, you must be logged to your Pi inside a console or thru SSH:
```bash
cd WHERE_CBATMO.ZIP_IS
unzip cbatmo.zip
cd cbatmo
yarn install --production
sudo cp rpi/cbatmo.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable cbatmo.service
sudo systemctl restart cbatmo.service
```

This steps install server dependencies, create a new cbatmo Systemd init script, launch this init script which will start automatically the web server in the Raspberry boot.
To verify if the server is running you can run this command `systemctl status cbatmo.service`. You must a get a result like this:

```bash
* cbatmo.service - CBatmo WEB server
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/cbatmo.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2019-12-30 09:52:10 CET; 2s ago
   Main PID: 357 (node)
      Tasks: 18 (limit: 1150)
     Memory: 32.9M
     CGroup: /system.slice/cbatmo.service
             |-357 node /usr/bin/yarn start
             `-369 /usr/bin/node server.js

Dec 30 09:52:10 picbatmo systemd[1]: Started CBatmo WEB server.
Dec 30 09:52:11 picbatmo CBatmo[357]: yarn run v1.21.1
Dec 30 09:52:11 picbatmo CBatmo[357]: $ node server.js
Dec 30 09:52:12 picbatmo CBatmo[369]: Server running on http://localhost:3000 as production
```

From your computer web-browser try to reach your Raspberry Pi by filling the ip address with port 3000 of your raspberry ex.: http://10.0.0.10:3000.
